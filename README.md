This is my attempt at this first assignment/assesment.
I used pretty much everything we learned during our sessions, from how to name variables
to unit testing (in a way). I added a testing section for every challenge using the
examples given and some more to cover more cases just in case. Every file was worked on
using TypeScript but tested on nodejs (tsc filename.ts ----- node filename.js), but I 
chose to just upload the ts files. Only in challenge 3 I was kind of not sure about it for 
one reason, it wasn't a difficult challenge but I was worried I didn't understand the given
at 100%. My concerns were about if there is always a missing number or not so I had a 
different approach at first but this is my final take on it. All I can say in the end these
challenges were interesting and helped me learned more by researching to find answers.
